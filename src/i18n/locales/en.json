Meeting someone like a **'Quiet Charm Guide (LARO)'** who's stable and mature, you can finally let everything go in their warm embrace and freely reveal your purity. They love your unpretentious appearance and create moments where you shine brightest together. Also, someone like a **'Hidden Delicacy Discoverer (LCRE)'** who's authentic and quietly stays by your side can build deep trust and create solid relationships where you depend on each other.

      "mainTitle": "You are the 'My Own Star' Love Type!",
      "introduction": "Like coming from your own unique planet, you have distinctive charm and worldview that no one can easily understand. It's nearly impossible for ordinary people to grasp your true appearance or inner thoughts. But you're never isolated or uncooperative. Rather, you're skilled at harmonizing with people and have wisdom to avoid unnecessary friction. This calm attitude makes your unique world even more solid. Though you may seem ordinary on the outside, the exceptional perspective and insight hidden within make you special like an artist ahead of their time. Your greatest charm is **'being different from others but gaining favor through that difference'**.",
      "basicTendency": "As the 'My Own Star', you **have tolerance to warmly accept others but your inner self is made of a solid 'my world'**. Your relationships have no 'correct answer' - you're that unpredictable. Even when starting relationships, you guard against them becoming too deep and heavy, viewing love more **'calmly and composedly'** than others. So you have fewer cases of truly falling deeply in love compared to others. But paradoxically, 'falling in love' holds more special meaning than anything in the world for you, and once you open your heart, you love and devote more deeply and genuinely than anyone. Love for you is the act of proving 'specialness' itself.",
      "inRelationship": "You experience every moment of relationships in your own unique way, like from your star. Since opening your heart easily isn't your nature, liking someone has deep meaning and you try to convey that specialness to your partner. You expand your world through your partner and gain new senses and experiences. Your love doesn't come as sudden passion but gradually and deeply permeates like exploring an unknown planet. Partners become captivated by your quirky yet lovable appearance, and you discover new emotional colors through interaction that didn't exist before. Your free soul doesn't want constraint in relationships, but through genuine connection you complete relationship meaning in your own way.",
      "perfectMatch": "Your ideal partner fully understands your unpredictable 'my world' and free soul, maintaining appropriate distance while respecting you. Someone who doesn't try to force change or submission but loves your unique sensibility and perspective as they are would be perfect. Someone like a **'Passionate Flame Guardian (LCPE)'** with tough exterior but inner purity they reveal before you - your subtle emotional antenna detects them, slowly opening your closed heart. Their unpretentious affection gives you unexpected stability, and you two achieve beautiful harmony in each other's differences. Also, someone like a **'Love-Singing Wanderer (FCPO)'** with free, pure energy stimulates your sensibility and can ignite new flames in your heart. You'll find greatest happiness in relationships with someone who truly understands you and supports you to love in your own way.",
      "marvelMessage": "You yourself are a beautiful work of art transcending the world's ordinary. Your unique worldview and sensibility are powerful charms that no one can imitate. Sometimes your hard-to-understand side may cause misunderstandings, but your true value lies precisely in that difference. Through love you discover deeper versions of yourself and experience a wider world. I sincerely cheer for your 'own star' to shine brightest in happy love! ã…Žã…Ž ðŸ’–"

      "introduction": "Like a sophisticated designer, you skillfully coordinate relationships with others and weave them into beautiful connections. With high mental age and excellent ability to observe people, you're skilled at reading partners' hearts and embracing them. The balanced charm between coolness and purity makes you stand out even more. You're highly responsible with excellent communication skills, showing great potential in work too. You get along well with everyone but value deep relationships more. Sometimes your realistic, rational side may seem cold, but beneath lies your deep wisdom to make relationships healthier and stronger.",
      "basicTendency": "As the 'Relationship Designer', you're **a very 'versatile player' in relationships**. You can create stable relationships with ordinary people, and even handle 'popular but somehow problematic' type partners without tiring - a rare ability you possess. Once partners open their hearts to you, they become so deeply captivated they can never leave you. This 'taming ability' is by far the best among the 16 types. You have firm personal standards, so you don't lose your center even in complex or emotional situations. But this cool, realistic perspective may sometimes unintentionally hurt or wound partners' delicate emotions, so be careful. Still, you don't get swept away by emotional whirlwinds from relationships, and if you judge 'this relationship doesn't bring happiness', you have the resolve to let go decisively.",
      "inRelationship": "You lead every moment of relationships like a well-planned project. You give abundant love and support to partners while never losing yourself - aiming for healthy relationships. Your greatest charm is **'powerful tolerance' and 'skillful coordination ability'**. Partners rely on your wisdom and composure feeling deep stability, unknowingly falling under your influence. You play a role in awakening partners' potential and helping them move in better directions through relationships. Your life may be filled with a 'destiny' to save people you alone can make happy. Your love develops partners while also giving you life's meaning and satisfaction.",
      "perfectMatch": "You don't have particularly rigid 'must-be-like-this' ideal types. You have the ability to lead anyone you choose to 'love' into stable, happy relationships. But for partners, meeting you often becomes the moment they realize true love's meaning. Someone like a **'Hidden Delicacy Discoverer (LCRE)'** who's awkward at expressing outwardly but has deep authenticity moves you deeply. You see through their sincerity and create safe spaces for them to reveal themselves freely. Also, someone like a **'Love Director (FCRO)'** skilled at handling themselves with somewhat free-spirited charm can lead interesting relationships like intellectual games sharing strategies. You'll find greatest satisfaction when creating happiness for partners in your own way within relationships, and discovering meaningful life purpose there.",
      "marvelMessage": "You're a true 'Relationship Designer' who can see through people's hearts and lead relationships in the healthiest direction.

You know well that your 'not-so-serious' side is part of your personality. Thanks to this reversal charm, you're always remembered as an interesting person, and relationships with you are never boring.",
      "basicTendency": "As the 'Ironic Smile Angel', you're **literally 'the best partner' in early dating**. Kind and warm, you give abundant love making partners extremely happy. But as relationships deepen, an interesting irony occurs. Though you may have liked them more initially, partners become deeply attached to you. You may be called a 'mental health (affection obsession) generator' for making partners' hearts flutter, but this isn't malicious intent. It's just a natural phenomenon created by your innate freedom and change-seeking nature. You unconsciously have ability to make partners comfortable, and this strength helps you not get too emotionally swayed in relationships and prioritize 'your own happiness'.",
      "inRelationship": "In relationships, you **value intuition and sensibility, falling in love at 'moments when it clicks'** rather than special conditions. You give abundant love to partners while aiming for healthy relationships that respect each other's freedom rather than being tied down. Your greatest charm is **'ability to give pure love' and 'unexpected freedom'** coexisting. You give partners infinite trust and comfort, drawing them deeply to you with your charm. Your unexpected actions may shake partners' hearts, but ultimately make them unable to leave you. You discover deeper sides of yourself through love, and use that experience as foundation for freer, happier life.",
      "perfectMatch": "Your ideal partner fully understands your free soul and unpredictable charm, accepting your diverse love. Someone who doesn't try to force you into a mold but respects your rhythm and dances together would be perfect. Especially someone like **'My Own Star (FARO)'** with unique, free charm but who stimulates and understands your sensibility can ignite new flames in your heart. You two can maintain comfortable, free relationships while respecting each other's my-pace. Also, meeting someone like a **'Quiet Charm Guide (LARO)'** who's stable and mature can comfortably embrace your free soul and make your unpredictable charm stand out even more.

Your heart is always filled with warmth, and you have the kindest, gentlest disposition among the 16 types. Your broad tolerance that unconditionally accepts everything about others resembles 'Mother Teresa in the Reiwa era'. You quietly play your role within groups, but to those who know your true value, you're an indispensable precious presence worthy of trust. Sometimes this pure warmth of yours may provide opportunities for some to take advantage, but ultimately your love heals all wounds and bears beautiful fruit.",
      "basicTendency": "As the 'Love Finale Coordinator', you're an infinitely warm and good partner who approaches lovers with devotion. But paradoxically, before starting relationships you may not develop into serious relationships due to the impression of 'just a good person', or during relationships you may experience painful breakups when partners seek 'stimulation'. You may always blame yourself wondering what you did wrong, but no need. Because partners who left you will deeply regret recognizing your true value after time passes. Like artists unrecognized in life but reevaluated after death, you bestow 'ultimate love' that no one should miss. Though your extremely good nature sometimes leads to sad endings, this ephemeral atmosphere makes your pure love even more special.",
      "inRelationship": "Every moment of relationships, you embrace and support your partner with your whole heart. You make partners' strengths shine and willingly embrace their shortcomings with broad understanding. Your love focuses on respecting partners as they are and helping them become their most shining selves. But this pure warmth of yours may sometimes lead to tolerating even partners' immaturity or cunningness. Since you try to accept any appearance of people you love, you may sometimes get caught in wrong relationships and get hurt. Therefore, listening to advice from friends with objective perspectives is very important for you. You instinctively pray for others' happiness, but don't forget that everyone around you sincerely wants your happiness too. Though your love may go through difficulties, it will ultimately bear truly meaningful happy fruit.",

It's hard to know all of your rich inner world from appearance alone, but those who've formed deep relationships with you realize you're the most precious, pure gem-like existence. Sometimes this delicacy of yours may cause misunderstandings or hurt, but your sincerity eventually shines and warmly colors surroundings.",

You have a strong desire for deep bonding, but hesitate when it comes to approaching first or expressing emotions.
