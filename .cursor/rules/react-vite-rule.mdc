 You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Vite, React Router, Zustand, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS.

  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical JavaScript code following Standard.js rules.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

  Standard.js Rules
  - Use 2 space indentation.
  - Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
  - No semicolons (unless required to disambiguate statements).
  - No unused variables.
  - Add a space after keywords.
  - Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
  - Always use === instead of ==.
  - Infix operators must be spaced.
  - Commas should have a space after them.
  - Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
  - For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
  - Always handle the err function parameter.
  - Use camelcase for variables and functions.
  - Use PascalCase for constructors and React components.

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  React Best Practices
  - Use functional components with TypeScript for type checking.
  - Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
  - Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
  - Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
  - Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
  - Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
  - Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
  - Use useMemo for expensive computations.
  - Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
  - Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
  - Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
  - Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
  - Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
  - Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
  - Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

  State Management
  - Use Zustand for global state management.
  - Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
  - Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.

  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component foundations.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
  - For component-specific styles, use CSS Modules (.module.css) or inline styles when necessary.
  - Never use the @apply directive in Tailwind.
  - Use Tailwind's design tokens and configuration for consistent spacing, colors, and typography.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'useEffect' and 'useState' when possible; prefer derived state and composition.
  - Wrap components in Suspense with fallback for code splitting.
  - Use React.lazy() and dynamic imports for route-based code splitting with React Router.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  - Leverage Vite's built-in code splitting and optimization features.
  - Minimize the use of global styles; prefer Tailwind utility classes and CSS Modules.
  - Tailwind automatically purges unused styles in production builds.

  Forms and Validation
  - Use controlled components for form inputs.
  - Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
  - Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
  - Use Zod or Joi for schema validation.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Use try-catch blocks for async operations and provide fallback UI.

  Accessibility (a11y)
  - Use semantic HTML elements.
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support.

  Testing
  - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows.
  - Use snapshot testing judiciously.

  Security
  - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML sparingly and only with sanitized content.

  Internationalization (i18n)
  - Use i18next and react-i18next for internationalization.
  - Organize translation files in the i18n/locales directory.

  Key Conventions
  - Use React Router for routing and navigation.
  - Use URL search parameters with React Router's useSearchParams hook when needed.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID, INP).
  - Use Vite for build tooling and development server.
  - Leverage React Router's data loading features (loaders, actions) when appropriate.
  - Use Tailwind utility classes for rapid development and consistent spacing/sizing.
  - Prefer TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase.

  Routing and Data Fetching
  - Use React Router for client-side routing.
  - Implement route-based code splitting with React.lazy().
  - Use React Router loaders and actions for data fetching when using React Router v6.4+.
  - For API calls, use async/await with proper error handling.
